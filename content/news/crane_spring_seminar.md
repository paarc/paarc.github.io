The Computational Research Access NEtwork (CRANE) is a free virtual Python workshop aimed at BIPOC and other underrepresented undergraduate students interested in physics and astronomy! This workshop consists of weekly python tutorials running from January 30, 2023 through April 28th, 2023, with topics ranging from introductory python coding, such as plotting, to more advanced topics, such as Monte Carlo methods and data analysis. The full schedule and list of topics can be found on our website at https://cranephysics.org/

This series is developed and run primarily by plasma physics and astronomy graduate students across the US who are underrepresented in their respective fields. Our goal is to create opportunities for students like us to enter research with a broad computational skill set.

CRANE scholars will also have access to workshops on applying to internships and individual help with applications. We hope that from these experiences, students will enter their scientific careers with the confidence and skills they need to pursue research.

Students are encouraged to apply using this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7aIIn0V8BPz9TgDgff7OktUD6vmnqyIgRdtsqOLrvUQEkpg/viewform).
