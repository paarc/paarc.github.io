[A weekend retreat hosted by PAARC dedicated to collective strategizing on DEI issues across universities.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/120489771149/)\

About this Event
--------
The Physics and Astronomy Anti-Racism Coalition (PAARC) is a collective of physics and astronomy graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduates dedicated to confronting and dismantling racist and anti-Black structures in academia. We are devoted to building connections and solidarity across universities, their faculty and staff, learning from one another about organizing, and creating and collecting anti-racist resources. We aim to build a physics and astronomy community that is fully committed to the goals of racial and social justice.

Over the last six months, we have brought together hundreds of scientists from all levels of academia that are committed to dismantling racism and other systems of oppression within physics and astronomy. **The PAARC Fair is an opportunity to capitalize further on this momentum and engage in nationwide collective action. Over the course of two days, we will be hosting a number of open sessions where both PAARC members and folks outside of PAARC can come together to share strategies, resources, and ideas.**
